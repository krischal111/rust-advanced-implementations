## About this repo

In this repository, I have implemented something that are advanced concepts.

However, advanced also contains some fun bit.

Check these files out:

[Fast Inverse Square Root from Quake III](q_rsqrt.rs)
This is an implementation of famous (0x5f3759df) inverse square toot algorithm in rust.

One more thing for rewrite everything in rust because, why not?
